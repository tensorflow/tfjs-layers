# TensorFlow.js: Layers API Benchmarks

These benchmarks measure the inference and training speed of models of
varying size and architecture, comparing TensorFlow.js in the browser with
Python Keras backed by TensorFlow.

To launch the benchmarks, do

```sh
cd integration_tests/benchmarks
./build-benchmarks.sh
```
