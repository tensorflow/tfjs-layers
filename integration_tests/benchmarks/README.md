# TensorFlow.js: Layers API Benchmarks

These benchmarks measure the inference and training speed of models of
varying size and architecture, comparing TensorFlow.js in the browser with
Python Keras backed by TensorFlow.

NOTE: This benchmark requires that you have TensorFlow and Keras installed in your
Python environment since it compares timing in Python to timing in the browser.

To launch the benchmarks, do

```sh
cd integration_tests/benchmarks
./build-benchmarks.sh
```
